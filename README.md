# Guess the Password

Simple browser game with an ES2015 refactor. Open `index.html` in the browser to play the game.

Your task is to refactor the app in two different ways.

1.  For the first refactor, convert the JavaScript in `app.js` to use ES2015 features.
1.  For the second refactor, convert the JavaScript in `app.js` to use jQuery instead of vanilla DOM manipulation.
